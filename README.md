Making use of mongoDB to Analyze a UK Food Hygiene Database

## Introduction
The UK Food Standards Agency evaluates various establishments across the United Kingdom, and gives them a food hygiene rating. This information has been imported into a mongo database in order to perform basic, and advance analysis for a fictitious food magazine. The goal is to evaluate some of the ratings data of the over 38K entries in order to help their journalists and food critics decide where to focus future articles. Review Jupyter Notebooks for results of these analysis.
